// Stage 2(C) parser: 'The Back End = The Pretty Printer'
//
// TODO!
//
// This one represents the classic textbook 'parser/tokenizer' backend: 
// using a 'tree walker' to generate 'object code output': in this case 
// the 'backend' is tasked to 'pretty print' the given formula
// so that the human user can be fed back her input, including possible
// color coding, error markup, tagging and what-not.
//
// This is yet another back-end to un alongside the others: 
// compile_calc_exec and compile_calc_codegen.
//
// The AST is stored in an array and since the AST acts as the INTERFACE
// between front-end and backend of the compiler/engine, its precise format
// is known to both 'parsers': the compile_calc_parse front-end and this
// back-end, plus additional back-ends which feed off the same AST for
// different purposes.
//
// This 'Pretty Printer' is designed to be FAST, hence the AST stream has been
// constructed the way it is, using a Polish Notation simile: this takes
// the fewest AST nodes and the fewest number of grammar rules to express 
// the entire formula calculation power.
//
// We also assume the AST is always valid (errors can be encoded in there, but
// we will exit HARD when your front-end screwed up the AST 'internal structure'
// in any way!), the result of which is that we now have enabled jison to 
// recognize the absence of all and any error checking and reporting facilities,
// which our JISON takes as an opportunity to create a severely stripped down,
// FAST grammar parser, hence a very fast 'tree walker'.
//
// Of course, the usual process is to write such a 'tree walker' by hand,
// but I want to showcase the concept here and there's something to say for
// readability as now AST format and actions performed on the atoms is 
// nicely separated! :-)
//
// ---
//
// A crucial detail is the use of the `%import` jison feature which allows
// us to import the symbol table generated by jison as part of the front-end
// parser engine: that way we have a guaranteed good set of token #IDs which we
// can use at both ends of the AST stream interface: this allows us to use 
// the other JISON feature which is `#<name>` in the action blocks everywhere:
// this will be expanded into the numeric ID of the given token by jison,
// saving us from having to generate and maintain a separate table of IDs
// for our AST objects!
//
// ---
//
// This example also uses the new JISON `%include` feature which allows us
// to include any given source file *verbatim* in our generated jison output.
// Thus we will produce a complete, working, app in a single file here.
// (See near bottom of this jison file.)
